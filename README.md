🚀 Announcement: My Web Development Journey

I’m officially starting my Web Development journey.

In the middle of the AI boom, it might seem like web development is “old news.” But the truth is, every AI product still needs a face, and that face is the web. Whether it’s deploying models, building dashboards, or creating interactive tools, the browser is still where ideas meet users.

That’s why I’m starting here. Web Dev isn’t just about pages—it’s about making technology accessible, usable, and real.

This repo will be my learning hub and growth log:

journey.md → progress log with milestones

notes/ → detailed .md files for concepts

projects/ → full builds to apply knowledge

This is more than learning syntax. It’s about building the foundation to ship products in a world where AI powers the backend and the web delivers it to people.

Web Dev is my starting point. The vision is bigger.
