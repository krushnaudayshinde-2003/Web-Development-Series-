ðŸ““ Learning Journey Log
ðŸ”” Update

Iâ€™ve already covered some core foundations:

CSS fundamentals:

ðŸ““ Day 14 â€“ Web Dev Journey
Today was all about CSS Flexbox.
Learned how to:
â€¢ use justify-content to control alignment
â€¢ add gap for spacing
â€¢ use align-items for vertical balance

Flexbox feels like magic for layoutsâ€”clean, powerful, and way less messy than floats. ðŸš€
