📓 Day 14 – Web Dev Journey
Today was all about CSS Flexbox.
Learned how to:
• use justify-content to control alignment
• add gap for spacing
• use align-items for vertical balance

Flexbox feels like magic for layouts—clean, powerful, and way less messy than floats. 🚀

📓 Day 15 – Web Dev Journey
Dived deeper into CSS today:
• z-index for layering
• flex-direction & flex-wrap for layout flow
• overflow control
• box-shadow for depth
• :hover & cursor: pointer for interactivity

📓 Day 16 – Web Dev Journey
Explored more CSS fundamentals:
• Boilerplate setup & universal selector *{}
• box-sizing for layout control
